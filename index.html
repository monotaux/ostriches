   <h2>Prefered killing method</h2>
   <p>Ostriches use their powerful legs to carry out their plan of mass destruction. With a 10-cm (4-in.) talon on each foot, their downward kicks can cause serious harm to potential predators.<a href="http://sabotagetimes.com/music/the-man-in-black-and-the-ostrich-attack-how-an-ostrich-set-johnny-cash-back-on-the-road-to-addiction">How an Ostrich almost killed a beloved icon</a></p>

       <h2>How to save your life from an ostrich attack</h2>
	   <li>If being charged, run for cover by hiding or getting to a high area.</li>
	   <li>If you cant run, use a long weapon and go for the neck, wings or legs while staying on it's side.</li>
	   <li>To avoid ostriches, do not walk in open landscapes where ostriches may roam, avoid close contact and beware of ostrich breeding season. They are more homicidal during this season.</li>
	</ul>
